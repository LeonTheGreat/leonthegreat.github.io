# leonthegreat.github.io
lenny's user page repo

Notes on GitHub Pages Use:
--------------------------
User/Org Pages:
must be in the leonthegreat.github.io repo, in the master branch - no other branch will work. This repo cannot hold any other Project pages, only the files for the User Page, i.e. the index.html file and other files you want to load in the browser when you open trixelated.com.

Project Pages:
Use Project Pages for sub-directories & files you want to use with trixelated.com in a sub-folder, i.e. trixelated.com/projects/index.html. These must be in the gh-pages branch, no other branch will work.

User Page(homepage for trixelated.com) is in leonthegreat.github.io, master branch(default)
Project Pages(trixelated.com/projects/, etc) is in the Projects repo, gh-pages branch(default)
Other sub-locations (trixelated.com/example/) might have to have their own repos, not sure yet.
